# Project Starter Files
This is repo holds all starter files that I use for beginning projects.

##Installation

Some things to note:

* This repository comes with NPM developer dependencies, which is included in the package.json file. 

* Do not clone these files unless working to improve upon the starter files. Instead, use the following command to install without creating a .git: 

```
git archive --remote=https://github.com/salogost/base.git @ | tar -t
```

* To install the developer dependencies, enter the following NPM commands into a terminal:

```
npm install
```
